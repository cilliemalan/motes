# Motes
It's like, a thing.

# Getting started
**Important:** This process will create a significant amount of GCP resources, it
is recommended that you have a $300 trial voucher, or at least terminate production
resources and disable production pipelines.


## Prerequisites
To run the project you will need:
1. [Download VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads) and install. This will
   be the minikube vm driver. (There are others but I'm going to use this one).
2. [Download Docker CE](https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/) and install. On Windows this is going to be a schlep. You really
   only need a docker client, but go ahead and install the whole thing for
   what it's worth. Make sure that you **don't** configure docker to run with HyperV. You
   will need VirtualBox to work for minikube to work.
   (Note: Yes, I know Minikube supports HyperV. If you're feeling
   lucky you can try to get started with that but I haven't gotten it to work reliably).
3. [Download Minikube](https://github.com/kubernetes/minikube/releases) and put it
   somewhere in your PATH.
   - Run `minikube start` in some console window. This will host our local k8s cluster.
   - Run `minikube docker-env` and follow the instructions for said console. This
     is to make docker use the docker engine inside minikube, which means that any
     containers you build we be available inside k8s. Make sure docker works by
     running `docker ps` (it will show no running images but should not fail).
4. [Download kubectl](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/install-kubectl/) and
   install it or get it in you PATH as well.
   - make sure it works by running `kubectl get all`. Note that minikube needs to
     download a number of images to get k8s started so it may take a few minutes
     for k8s to come online.
5. [Download GCloud SDK](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/downloads) and install.
6. [Download Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/) and 
   install it or get it in you PATH. *Terraform* will create our GoCD server for us and
   make sure DNS is pointing to the right place and everything. **Before you begin** make
   sure to tweak the settings inside `terraform.tfvars`. This file contains the settings
   for our project (DNS name, GCP project, etc.).
   - make sure Terraform works by running `terraform --version`
7. [Download NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/). Get the latest version, not LTS.
   - make sure it works by running `node --version` and `npm --version`

## GCP Project and variables
You will need to create a project on GCP and change the variables in `terraform.tfvars`
The variables in this file are used througout the scripts for the project. Even if you
don't intend to deploy your project into the cloud, it will still be a good idea to
create a GCP project regardless as many scripts do sanity checks in this regard.

Once the project is created you will have to run `gcloud init` and authorize that project.
You will also need to [create credentials and save them](https://cloud.google.com/docs/authentication#setting_up_a_service_account)
as `gcp-credentials.json`. **Do not commit credentials** The file `gcp-credentials.json` is
ignored by `.gitignore` by default.

# Getting started locally
Before we put this project in the cloud, let's get it running locally first.

The steps for running the application (including all supporting services) are:
  1. Create the k8s cluster
  2. Provision supporting services inside k8s (zookeeper, mongo, etc)
  3. Provision the application (for a remote deployment only)

In your development environment, step 3 is omitted and instead a dev pod is created 
directly and the application is run and debugged in that.

## 1. Prerequisites revisited
I assume you have installed the prereqs above, but let's go over them once again to make
extra super duper sure everything is in place.

First, check that minikube is started
```
$ minikube status
minikubeVM: Started
localkube: Started
```

Make sure that your docker uses the minikube docker environment (see prereqs above).
Here it shows the running containers for the k8s cluster:
```
$ docker ps --filter "name=k8s" --format "{{.ID}} {{.RunningFor}} {{.Names}}"

```

Make sure that kubectl is working:
```
$ kubectl get all --namespace kube-system
NAME                             READY     STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
po/kube-addon-manager-minikube   1/1       Running   8          19d

rs/kube-dns-268032401   1         1         1         18d
```

As you may have guessed, these pods correspond to the output of docker ps.

**Note:** You may want to check out the the k8s dashboard. This can be seen by running
`minikube dashboard` from the console. It's okay if it says "Nothing to display here". We
haven't created anything yet.

Next, we have a script that will quickly check that local prerequisite applications
are installed and available. To run it, run this from the project root:
```
$ ./build-scripts/check-prerequisites.sh
Checking prerequisites...
GCP Project: dust-motes
GCP Project: europe-west1
GCP Project: dust-motes.com
Could not sudo - good!
Docker good!
Docker perms good!
Kubectl good!
Terraform good!
Node good!
gcloud good!
gcloud project dust-motes good!
All good!
```

If it says "All good!" then all prereqs are accounted for and we can move on to the next step!

## 2. Local prerequisites
Next let's see if our local build prereqs are in order. This basically does npm install
and does a few linting checks

First, run the prereqs script:
```
$ ./build-scripts/local-prepare.sh
```

It will install node packages for the `web` project.

Next, run some local tests:
```
$ ./build-scripts/run-tests.sh
up to date in 2.247s

> motes-web@1.0.0-alpha test C:\Projects\motes\web
> mocha --grep "^(?!Ecosystem|Integration).+"



  Testing system
    internals
      âˆš should function


  1 passing (16ms)

```

Everything passes, so let's move on.

### Note: Folder structure
Before moving on, let's take a quick look at the folder structure.

| Folder | What it's for |
|--------|---------------|
| `build-scripts` | Contains all scripts for the build process |
| `build-scripts/utilities` | Contains some helper scripts |
| `deployments` | Contains the k8s deployment spec files. Note: these files cannot be loaded as they are as they require some preprocessing. |
| `deployments/app` | Deployment files for the core application. |
| `deployments/ecosystem` | Deployment files for supporting infrastructure (e.g. redis, zookeeper) |
| `infrastructure-scripts` | Scripts for the goCD server. |
| `grafana`, `grafana-proxy`, `graphite`, `redis`, `zookeeper`, `web-proxy`, `web` | Each of these folders will be built into a docker image. The `docker-build-all.sh` script loops through all the directories and builds each one with a `Dockerfile` in it. |
| `web` | This is the main web application. |


## 3. Deploying supporting infrastructure
Now we are ready to starting making infrastructure. First thing is to build the docker images.

This will take a good while and a fast internet connection will help. Subsequent builds will be quick.

To build all docker images for our environment run:
```
$ ./build-scripts/build-docker-images.sh
```








# Deploying the project to GCP

First things first, you'll need a gocd server. This repos is fused with
[continuous-delivery-example](https://github.com/cilliemalan/continuous-delivery-example)
(i.e. all the files there are also in this project) so the readme there will get you
started.

Create the GoCD server by tweaking `terraform.tfvars` and the following the steps in
[the readme there](https://github.com/cilliemalan/continuous-delivery-example#continuous-delivery-example)

# Building this thing
Once your GoCD server has been set up, log in and head to config XML page 
(go to *Admin* -> *Config XML*). Edit this XML and add this XML node between
`<server>` and `<agents>`. Replace `YOUR REPO URL HERE` with your git URL (ending
with the .git) (**Important**: for some reason the thing freaks out if you put
it after `<agents>`).
```
<config-repos>
  <config-repo plugin="yaml.config.plugin">
    <git url="YOUR REPO URL HERE" />
  </config-repo>
</config-repos>
```
Save this config and head to the home page of your GoCD server. Give it a couple
of seconds and it should load it's pipeline config from the repo.
